# Arduino Uno Mercury Open Optical Module

#### Project Overview

This project utilizes an Arduino Uno to interface with a Mercury open optical module to detect the module's state (open or closed). The module outputs a signal that is read by the Arduino Uno, which then displays the status on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Mercury Open Optical Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Mercury Open Optical Module to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the module to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the module to 5V on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the GND pin of the module to GND on the Arduino Uno.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the Mercury open optical module to the Arduino Uno according to the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the messages indicating whether the module is open or closed based on the sensor state.

#### Applications

- **Security Systems:** Detect the open or closed state of doors, windows, or compartments.
- **Automation:** Integrate with systems requiring state detection for operational decisions.
- **Monitoring:** Use in environments where state changes need to be monitored and logged.

#### Notes

- Ensure the Mercury open optical module is correctly positioned and aligned for accurate state detection.
- Adjust the code logic or use additional components as needed based on specific project requirements.
- Test the module in the intended application environment to validate functionality and reliability.
